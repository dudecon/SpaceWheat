## New Mechanics

### 1. Inverse Gating (Starvation)

Normal gating: `rate × P(gate)^power`
Inverse gating: `rate × (1 - P(gate))^power`

| Target | Source | Gate | Inverse? | Effect |
|--------|--------|------|----------|--------|
| 💀 | 🧤 | 🗑 | ✅ YES | Refugees starve when waste is LOW |

When P(🗑) = 1: rate × 0 = no starvation
When P(🗑) = 0: rate × 1^1.2 = maximum starvation

**Gameplay**: Refugees survive near garbage. Clean cities kill them.

### 2. Measurement Inversion

```gdscript
measurement_behavior = {
    "🧤": {"inverts": true, "invert_target": "🗑"}
}
```

When the player tries to COUNT refugees:
- The wave function collapses
- But to the OPPOSITE state
- 🧤 → 🗑 (they become statistics, waste, nothing)

**Gameplay**: You cannot harvest refugees. You can only watch them starve or count them into oblivion.

### 3. Negative Self-Energy (💸 Anti-Money)

```gdscript
f.self_energies = {
    "💸": -0.3,  # NEGATIVE
}

f.hamiltonian = {
    "💸": {
        "💰": -0.8,  # NEGATIVE coupling (annihilation)
    }
}
```

Debt is literally anti-wealth. When 💸 and 💰 coexist:
- Negative coupling → probability sloshes between them
- Net cancellation toward zero
- System is unstable

**Gameplay**: You can't have rich indebted populations. Wealth and debt annihilate.

### 4. Cross-Faction Void References

Void Serfs reference ⚫ (true void) without speaking it:

```gdscript
f.signature = ["👥", "⛓", "🌑", "💸"]  # ⚫ NOT here

f.hamiltonian = {
    "🌑": {
        "⚫": 0.6,  # Cross-faction coupling TO true void
    }
}

f.lindblad_outgoing = {
    "🌑": {
        "⚫": 0.01,  # Dark slowly drains to void
    }
}
```

**Narrative**: They sense the true void but cannot name it. They're being pulled toward heat death but don't have the vocabulary.

## Edict → Law Pipeline

```
CARRION THRONE              STATION LORDS
    🏰                          🏢
     │                           │
     ▼                           │
    📜 ────────────────────────→ 📜 ──→ 📘
  (edict)     L_out: 0.05      (received)   (trade law)
     │                           │
  generated                   metabolized
  by 🏰+⚜                     rate: 0.06
```

Edicts are CONSUMED by the bureaucracy and transformed into law.

📜 (edict) properties:
- Generated by 🏰 castle
- Decays at 0.03/s to 🗑 if not processed
- Flows to 🏢 at 0.05/s

📘 (trade law) properties:
- Created from 📜 at 0.06/s
- Enables 🚢 shipping (GATED)
- Decays slowly (0.005/s)

## Emergent Gameplay Scenarios

### The Refugee Paradox
```
Empire generates 🗑 waste → 🧤 refugees appear
Empire tries to count refugees → 🧤 → 🗑 (they become statistics)
Result: More waste, more refugees, cannot extract them

Only way to reduce refugees:
1. Clean up waste (they starve)
2. Or let them be (they exist in superposition)
```

### The Debt Spiral
```
Void Serfs: 👥 → 💸 (population accrues debt)
            💸 → ⛓ (debt creates bondage)
            ⛓ + 👥 → 💰 (bondage enables extraction)
            
But: 💸 × 💰 = negative coupling = annihilation

The empire extracts wealth but creates debt
The debt annihilates the wealth
Net zero. The void wins.
```

### The Edict Flood
```
Carrion Throne: 🏰 → 📜 (castle generates edicts)
Station Lords: 📜 → 📘 (edicts become law)

If 📜 generation > 📘 metabolism:
  - Edicts pile up
  - Decay to 🗑 at 0.03/s
  - 🗑 → 🧤 refugees appear
  
The bureaucracy creates refugees by failing to keep up.
```

### The Prophet's Dilemma
```
Yeast Prophets need healthy 🫙 starter
🫙 decay = 0.04/s (needs constant feeding)
🫙 fed by 🍞 (0.02) and 💧 (0.03)

If 🍞 production drops:
  🫙 dies → 🥖 production stops (gated)
  No fine bread → less 💰
  Less 💰 → empire weakens
  
The prophets hold the key to refined civilization.
```

## Quantum Weirdness Density by Ring

| Ring | Factions | Weirdness Level |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| Center | Granary, Millwright, Yeast | Normal dynamics |
| Second | Station Lords | Bureaucracy as measurement |
| Outer | Void Serfs | Negative energy, void coupling |
