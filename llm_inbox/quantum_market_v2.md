💹 Quantum Market Architecture v2: Emergent ExchangeVersion: 2.0 (Model C Compliant)Status: DESIGN FINALIZEDParadigm: Dissipative Quantum Economics1. The Core Infrastructure: The 3-Axis MarketIn Model C, the Market is not a "pile of emojis" but a strictly defined 3-qubit (8-dimensional) resonance chamber. Additional commodities are handled via dynamic register allocation (up to a computational limit).The Primary Market Axes (The Core 8D State)| Qubit | Axis | |0⟩ (North) | |1⟩ (South) | Physical Meaning ||-------|------|--------------|--------------|------------------|| 0 | Sentiment | 🐂 Bull | 🐻 Bear | Market momentum / "Mood" || 1 | Liquidity | 💰 Money | 💳 Debt | Available capital for exchange || 2 | Stability | 🏛️ Order | 🏚️ Chaos | Volatility damping factor |The Commodity Registers (Dynamic)When a commodity (e.g., 🌾 or 💨) is "shipped" to the market, the biome allocates a new register.Subspace mapping: Price emerges from the Coupling Strength ($\Omega$) between the Commodity Axis and the Liquidity Axis.2. Emergent Pricing: The Spectroscopic ModelPrice is no longer a variable; it is a Tunneling Rate.The Hamiltonian ExchangeThe "Price" of a commodity $C$ is the effective rate at which population moves from $|C\rangle$ (Commodity) to $|💰\rangle$ (Money).$$H_{market} = H_{core} + \sum \Omega_i (|C_i\rangle\langle 💰| + h.c.)$$Price via Detuning ($\Delta$)The "Exchange Rate" is suppressed by Detuning.Resonance ($\Delta \approx 0$): High Price. Population tunnels fast.Detuned ($\Delta \gg 0$): Low Price. Population is "stuck" in commodity state.Sentiment's Role:The Sentiment Qubit (🐂/🐻) acts as a Parametric Driver.In a Bull Market ($P(🐂) \to 1$), the energy gap between commodities and money is narrowed ($\Delta$ decreases).In a Bear Market ($P(🐻) \to 1$), the gap widens, making it "expensive" (slow) to convert goods to cash.3. The Classical-Quantum Bridge (Trading)Phase A: Injection (Selling)When a player sells 10 units of 💨:Deduct 10 units from classical inventory.Activate Lindblad Drive on the Market's Flour Register:$$L = \sqrt{\gamma} |💨\rangle\langle 🌾|$$This "pumps" the flour population in the market bath without violating $Tr(\rho)=1$.Phase B: Conversion (Evolution)The Hamiltonian evolves the state. If the market is "Hot" (Bullish), the population rotates:$$|💨\rangle \rightarrow |💰\rangle$$Phase C: Extraction (Harvesting)The player doesn't "get paid" instantly. They Harvest the Liquidity.Projective measurement on the Liquidity Register.If outcome is $|0\rangle$ (💰), the player receives classical credits based on the measured amplitude.4. Guardrails & Rigor1. Liquidity Crises (Trace Conservation)The total "Money" in the market is capped by the trace of the Liquidity Subspace. If the market is out of $💰$ population, no matter how much you drive the commodity axis, you cannot extract cash. You must wait for the market to "refill" (natural Lindblad pump from the 🏛️ Order icon).2. Market Impact (Backaction)Injecting massive amounts of a commodity ($💨$) provides a Backaction on the Sentiment Qubit.High $P(💨)$ increases the detuning for the 🐂 state.Emergent Behavior: Over-supplying the market naturally triggers a Bear shift ($🐻$), dropping the price.3. Partial Trace ObservablesThe UI "Ticker" shows the price by calculating the Spectral Overlap:$$Price \approx \text{Tr}(\rho \cdot \mathcal{O}_{exchange})$$Where $\mathcal{O}_{exchange}$ is the operator representing the resonance between commodity and money.5. Implementation Directives for BotsInitialization: Start MarketBiome as an 8D state ($2^3$ qubits).Expansion: Use inject_icon() to add tradeable goods.Price Query: Implement get_exchange_rate(emoji) by calculating the current Hamiltonian resonance, NOT a lookup table.Conservation: Ensure all trades are Lindblad-driven transfers to maintain $Tr(\rho)=1$.SummaryThe Market is now a Quantum Heat Engine. Money is the "work" extracted from the "heat" of market sentiment. If the player understands the resonance, they profit. If they ignore the detuning, they collapse their own value.
