📍 YOU ARE HERE: /home/tehcr33d/llm_outbox/kitchen_architecture_review/

📚 READ FIRST:
   1. README.md (orientation)
   2. 00_INVESTIGATION_OVERVIEW.md (context + findings)
   3. 01_GAMEPLAY_LOOP_SPECIFICATION.md (what the kitchen teaches)
   4. 02_SYSTEMS_ANALYSIS.md (how everything works)
   5. 05_DESIGN_DECISION_FRAMEWORK.md (*** CRITICAL: 3 decisions to make ***)
   6. 06_SIMULATION_EVIDENCE.md (proof of current state)

⏱️  ESTIMATED READING TIME: 2-3 hours

🎯 YOUR JOB:
   1. Review the documents
   2. Choose answers to 3 critical decisions (A, B, C)
   3. Return with your choices
   4. We implement according to your architecture

📊 KEY FINDINGS:
   ✅ Wheat/Mill/Kitchen systems work individually
   ❌ Wheat not consumed after mill measurement (can measure infinitely)
   ❌ Energy taps fail (emoji not in biome)
   ⚠️  3 architectural questions need answers

🔑 THE THREE DECISIONS:

   Decision A: Mill Physics
   ├─ A1: Destructive (wheat consumed)
   ├─ A2: Non-destructive + outcome tracking
   └─ A3: Renewable (wheat infinite)

   Decision B: Energy Tap Model
   ├─ B1: Plot-level buildings
   ├─ B2: Biome-level quantum operations
   └─ B3: Auto-injected global emoji set

   Decision C: Cross-Biome Kitchen Access
   ├─ C1: Kitchen biome only
   ├─ C2: Cross-biome aware
   └─ C3: Unified global quantum computer

⚡ START IMMEDIATELY:
   1. Open: README.md
   2. Open: 05_DESIGN_DECISION_FRAMEWORK.md
   3. Pick your A, B, C options
   4. Come back to Claude with decisions

🧪 TEST COMMAND (if you want to verify findings):
   cd /home/tehcr33d/ws/SpaceWheat
   timeout 20 godot --headless -s /tmp/test_physics_issues.gd 2>&1 | tail -100

✨ PRINCIPLE:
   We're not restricting your design, we're clarifying the options.
   You choose the approach that makes sense for Space Wheat.
